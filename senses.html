    An ear is the organ that enables hearing and, in mammals, body balance using the vestibular system. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word "ear" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.

    The ear develops from the first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from ectoderm.
    
    The ear may be affected by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.
    
    The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewelry in numerous cultures for thousands of years, and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations.

<div class="bones-1">
    <div class="e-t1"> what is the ear?</div>
Your ears are organs that detect and analyze sound. Located on each side of your head, they help with hearing and balance.
</div>
<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-1">FUNCTION</div>
What is the main function of the ear?
Your ears have two main functions: hearing and balance.
<div class="ear-1">
    <div class="et-1">Hearing:</div>
 When sound waves enter your ear canal, your tympanic membrane (eardrum) vibrates. This vibration passes on to three tiny bones (ossicles) in your middle ear. The ossicles amplify and transmit these sound waves to your inner ear. Once the sound waves reach your inner ear, tiny hair cells called stereocilia transform the vibrations into electrical energy and send it along nerve fibers to your brain.
</div>
<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-1">Balance</div> 
Your inner ear contains semicircular canals filled with fluid and hair-like sensors. When you move your head, the fluid inside these loop-shaped canals sloshes around and moves the hairs. The hairs transmit this information along the vestibular nerve to your brain. Finally, your brain sends signals to your muscles to help you stay balanced.
</div>

    <div class="et-1">ANATOMY</div>
    <div class="et-2">Where are my ears located?</div>
  <div class="img-1"><img src="/image/24048-ear.jpg"></div>
    <div class="ear-1">
Your ears are on either side of your head, directly over your temporal lobe. This part of your brain is responsible for hearing, speech, memory and some emotion.</div>
<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">What are the parts of the ear?</div>
The three main parts of your ear include the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. Your tympanic membrane (eardrum) separates your outer ear and middle ear.</div>
<div class="ear-">
    <div class="et-2">Outer ear (external ear)</div>
Your outer ear is the part of your ear that’s visible. It’s what most people mean when they say “ear.” Also called the auricle or pinna, your outer ear consists of ridged cartilage and skin, and it contains glands that secrete ear wax. Its funnel-shaped canal leads to your eardrum, or tympanic membrane.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Middle ear</div>
Your middle ear begins on the other side of your tympanic membrane (eardrum). There are three tiny bones in this area — the malleus, incus and stapes. (Healthcare providers refer to these three bones as the ossicles.) They transfer sound vibrations from your eardrum to your inner ear. Your middle ears also house the eustachian tubes, which help equalize the air pressure in your ears.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Inner ear</div>
Your inner ear contains two main parts: the cochlea and the semicircular canals. Your cochlea is the hearing organ. This snail-shaped structure contains two fluid-filled chambers lined with tiny hairs. When sound enters, the fluid inside of your cochlea causes the tiny hairs to vibrate, sending electrical impulses to your brain.</div>

The semicircular canals, also known as the labyrinthine, are responsible for balance. They tell your brain which direction your head is moving.
</div>

<div class="img-2"><img src="/image/stock-vector-vector-medical-poster-ear-diseases-symptoms-of-the-disease-1512767066.jpg">
<div class="et-1">CONDITIONS AND DISORDERS</div>
<div class="et-2">What are some ear problems?</div>

There are many diseases and conditions that can affect your ears, including infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, swimmer’s ear and more.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Ear infection (otitis media)</div>

Ear infections most commonly occur in your middle ear. Otitis media develops when bacteria and viruses become trapped in your middle ear. This type of infection is more likely to affect children than adults. Ear infection treatment usually involves antibiotics. In severe cases, ear tubes may be necessary.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Eustachian tube dysfunction</div>
Your eustachian tubes connect your middle ears to your throat. When you yawn, sneeze or swallow, your eustachian tubes open to equalize the pressure inside of your ears. If these tubes become clogged, it’s called eustachian tube dysfunction. Symptoms include tinnitus, muffled hearing, sensation of fullness and possible ear pain.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Swimmer’s ear (otitis externa)</div>
Swimmer’s ear is an ear canal infection caused by bacteria or fungi. Getting water in your ear can cause this condition. Swimmer’s ear can also occur if you get hair spray or other irritants inside of your ear canal. Additionally, it’s common for people to injure their ear canal with cotton swabs. (Note: When ear cleaning, you should never place cotton swabs inside of your ear canal.)</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Ruptured eardrum</div>
If you get a hole in your tympanic membrane, it’s called a ruptured eardrum. (Your eardrum separates your outer ear from your middle ear.) Infection, trauma, loud sounds or foreign objects in your ears can cause a ruptured eardrum. In most cases, a ruptured eardrum will heal on its own in a few weeks. But sometimes, it requires surgical repair, such as tympanoplasty.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Otosclerosis</div>
Otosclerosis is when abnormal bone remodeling occurs in your middle ear. Bone remodeling is a normal lifelong process in which existing bone tissue replaces itself with new bone tissue. When this process doesn’t go as expected, however, it can cause health problems. With otosclerosis, the tiny bones inside of your middle ear (the malleus, incus and stapes) become hardened and stop vibrating. As a result, sound doesn’t travel properly. Surgery is usually necessary to treat otosclerosis.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Perichondritis</div>
Perichondritis occurs when the skin of your outer ear becomes infected. This condition is usually the result of injury or trauma, such as piercings, contact sports or ear surgery. Antibiotics are necessary to treat perichondritis. In rare cases, you may need surgery to drain any pus from the area.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Vestibular neuritis</div>

Vestibular neuritis occurs when the vestibular nerve in your inner ear becomes inflamed. People with this condition experience a sudden vertigo attack, which is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Your healthcare provider will treat vestibular neuritis with medication and possible physical therapy.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Meniere’s disease</div>
This chronic condition affects your inner ear. Common symptoms include dizziness, vertigo and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Most of the time, Meniere’s disease improves on its own over time. However, in severe cases, surgery might be necessary.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Ear injury</div>
Cuts, fractures and blunt force trauma can cause ear injury. If damage is severe, surgery may be necessary to address the problem. This may include surgery to preserve hearing or cosmetic surgery to improve the appearance of your ear.</div>

<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-2">Ear tumors</div>
Ear tumors may be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Types of noncancerous ear tumors include keloids, sebaceous cysts, osteomas and exostoses (bone growths). Noncancerous ear tumors usually require surgical removal.
Cancers that can affect your ears include melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment for these conditions depends on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, and whether or not it has spread to other parts of your body.

<!-- <div class="img-2"><img src="/image/stock-vector-vector-medical-poster-ear-diseases-symptoms-of-the-disease-1512767066.jpg"> -->
There are a number of symptoms that could indicate a problem with your ears.
<div class="et-1">
These warning signs include:</div>
<div class="ear-1">
Ear pain.
Ear infection.
Clogged ears.
Muffled hearing.
Itchy ears.
Nausea and vomiting.
A feeling of fullness in your ears.
Ear drainage.
What tests will my healthcare provider use to check my ears?
Your healthcare provider can perform a wide range of tests to check your ears. </div></div>

<div class="ear-1">

<div class="et-1">Common hearing tests include:</div>

Pure-tone testing. This simple hearing test involves wearing headphones and raising your hand when you hear a “beep.” Pure-tone testing tells your healthcare provider the quietest sound you can hear at different frequencies.
Middle ear tests. These tests can determine how well your eardrum functions. They can also tell your healthcare provider if you have a ruptured eardrum.
Speech testing. Sometimes, your provider may give you a speech test to determine how well you hear and repeat words.
Auditory brainstem response (ABR). During this test, your provider places electrodes on your head. These electrodes record your brain activity. The goal is to see how your brain responds to sounds played through headphones. The ABR is often performed on people who can’t complete a typical hearing screening.
Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). This test determines how well your cochlea works. When sound reaches your inner ear, the tiny hairs inside of your cochlea vibrate. This vibration produces a very soft sound that echoes back into your middle ear (an otoacoustic emission, or OAE). If you have significant hearing loss, your inner ear won’t produce OAEs at all.</div>


<div class="ear-1">
<div class="et-1">CARE</div>
<div class="et-2">How can I properly care for my ears?</div>


Here are some tips to keep your ears as healthy as possible:

Keep your ears dry by wearing ear plugs when swimming.
Don’t use cotton swabs to clean your ear canal.
Wear protective equipment when playing contact sports.
Turn the volume down when listening to music through headphones.
Wear ear plugs if you’re around loud noises.
Visit your healthcare provider for routine ear examinations.

<div class="t-1">What is the throat?</div>
<div class="throat-t1">
The throat (pharynx and larynx) is a ring-like muscular tube that acts as the passageway for air, food and liquid. It is located behind the nose and mouth and connects the mouth (oral cavity) and nose to the breathing passages (trachea [windpipe] and lungs) and the esophagus (eating tube). The throat also helps in forming speech.</div>
<div class="t-1">side view of internal throat structureThe throat contains the:</div>

<div class="throat-t1">
    
    <div class="th-1">Tonsils and adenoids - </div>  made up of lymph tissue. Tonsils are located at the back and sides of the mouth and adenoids are located behind the nose. They both help to fight infections. Removal of tonsils and adenoids, when necessary, will not reduce your child's ability to fight infections since there are many other tissues to perform that function.</div>
<div class="throat-t1">
    <div class="th-1">Pharynx —</div> is the muscle-lined space that connects the nose and mouth to the larynx and esophagus (eating tube).
    <div class="throat-t1">
        <div class="th-1">Larynx — </div>also known as the voice box, the larynx is a cylindrical grouping of cartilages, muscles and soft tissue that contains the vocal cords. The larynx is the upper opening into the windpipe (trachea), the passageway to the lungs.</div>
<div class="throat-t1">
    <div class="th-1">Epiglottis — </div>a flap of soft tissue and cartilage located just above the vocal cords. The epiglottis folds down over the vocal cords to help prevent food and irritants from entering the lungs.</div>
<div class="throat-t1"><div class="th-1">Subglottic space —</div> the space immediately below the vocal cords. It is the narrowest part of the upper airway</div>

<div class="throat-2">
<div class="throat-t-1">Home remedies for a sore throat</div>

You can treat most sore throats at home. Get plenty of rest to give your immune system a chance to fight the infection.

To relieve the pain of a sore throat:
<ul>
<li>Gargle with a mixture of warm water and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
<li>Drink warm liquids that feel soothing to the throat, such as hot tea with honey, soup broth, or warm water with lemon. </li>
<li>Herbal teas can beTrusted Source especially soothing to a sore throat.</li>
<li>Cool your throat by eating a cold treat like a popsicle or ice cream.</li>
<li>Suck on a piece of hard candy or a lozenge.</li>
<li>Turn on a cool mist humidifier to add moisture to the air.</li>
<li>Rest your voice until your throat feels better.</li>
</ul>



<div class="throat-t-1">How to prevent a sore throat</div>
While a sore throat cannot always be avoided, there are several steps you can take to help prevent it.

Some ways you may be able to prevent a sore throat includeTrusted Source:
<ul>
<li> your hands regularly</li>
<li>limit close contact with others who have respiratory infections, sore throats, and colds</li>
<li>if you smoke, consider quitting</li>
<li> exposure to secondhand smoke as much as possible</li>
</ul>


<div class="throat-t-1">When to see a doctor</div>
Sore throats that are caused by a viral infection usually get better on their own within 7 daysTrusted Source. However, some causes of a sore throat need to be treated.

Call a doctor if you have any of these potentially more serious symptoms:
<ul>
<li>severe sore throat</li>
<li>trouble swallowing</li>
<li>trouble breathing, or pain when you breathe</li>
<li>difficulty opening your mouthsore joints</li>
<li>a fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius)</li>
<li>painful or stiff neck</li>
<li>blood in your saliva or phlegm</li>
<li>a sore throat that lasts for more than a week</li>
</ul>

<div class="throat-t-1">When you need antibiotics</div>
Antibiotics treat infections caused by bacteria, like strep throat. They won’t treat viral infections.

You need to treat a strep throat with antibiotics to prevent more serious complications like pneumonia, bronchitis, and rheumatic fever. Antibiotics can reduce sore throat pain by about 1 day, and lower the risk of rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds.

Doctors usually prescribe a course of antibiotics lasting about 10 daysTrusted Source. It’s important to take all of the medication as prescribed, even if you start to feel better.

Stopping an antibiotic too early can leave some bacteria alive, which can make you sick again. It can also lead toTrusted Source antibiotic resistance, making it more challenging to treat infections using antibiotics in the future.
