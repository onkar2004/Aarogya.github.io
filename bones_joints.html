    <div class="bones-1">
      Structure Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix
      (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%) which are intricately woven and
      endlessly remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique
      composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong,
      while remaining lightweight. Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic
      collagen fibers, also known as ossein, and the remainder is ground
      substance.The elasticity of collagen improves fracture resistance.
      The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt, calcium
      phosphate, in a chemical arrangement known as bone mineral, a form of
      calcium hydroxylapatite. It is the mineralization that gives bones
      rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by
      special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single
      bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as cortical and
      cancellous bone, each with a different appearance and characteristics.

    <div class="bones-1">

      <img src="/image/interesting-and-surprising-facts-about-the-human-skeleton.png">
      Composition Main article: Extracellular matrix Bones consist of living
      cells (osteoblasts and osteocytes) embedded in a mineralized organic
      matrix. The primary inorganic component of human bone is hydroxyapatite,
      the dominant bone mineral, having the nominal composition of
      Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2.[24] The organic components of this matrix consist mainly
      of type I collagen—"organic" referring to materials produced as a result
      of the human body—and inorganic components, which alongside the dominant
      hydroxyapatite phase, include other compounds of calcium and phosphate
      including salts. Approximately 30% of the acellular component of bone
      consists of organic matter, while roughly 70% by mass is attributed to the
      inorganic phase.[25] The collagen fibers give bone its tensile strength,
      and the interspersed crystals of hydroxyapatite give bone its compressive
      strength. These effects are synergistic.The exact composition of the
      matrix may be subject to change over time due to nutrition and
      biomineralization, with the ratio of calcium to phosphate varying between
      1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as magnesium, sodium,
      potassium and carbonate also be found.[25] Type I collagen composes 90-95%
      of the organic matrix, with the remainder of the matrix being a homogenous
      liquid called ground substance consisting of proteoglycans such as
      hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate,[25] as well as non-collagenous
      proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin or bone sialoprotein. Collagen
      consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength,
      and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The
      function of ground substance is not fully known.[25] Two types of bone can
      be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen:
      woven and lamellar. Woven bone (also known as fibrous bone), which is
      characterized by a haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is
      mechanically weak.[26] Lamellar bone, which has a regular parallel
      alignment of collagen into sheets ("lamellae") and is mechanically
      strong.[26] Transmission electron micrograph of decalcified woven bone
      matrix displaying characteristic irregular orientation of collagen fibers
      Woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which
      occurs initially in all fetal bones, but is later replaced by more
      resilient lamellar bone. In adults, woven bone is created after fractures
      or in Paget's disease. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of
      randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this
      appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed woven. It is soon
      replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in concentric sheets
      with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar
      bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the fetus during the
      third trimester, is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers
      parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are
      called osteons). In cross-section, the fibers run in opposite directions
      in alternating layers, much like in plywood, assisting in the bone's
      ability to resist torsion forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms
      initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process
      known as "bony substitution." Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone
      formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen
      fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2 µm per day.
      Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen
      fibers in parallel or concentric layers

    <div class="title-b-1">Types Of Bones</div>
    <div class="bones-1">
        There are five types of bones in the human body: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid.

        Long bones are characterized by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width; and by an epiphysis, a rounded head at each end of the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones.[32] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified long bones.
        Short bones are roughly cube-shaped, and have only a thin layer of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. The bones of the wrist and ankle are short bones.
        Flat bones are thin and generally curved, with two parallel layers of compact bone sandwiching a layer of spongy bone. Most of the bones of the skull are flat bones, as is the sternum.
        Sesamoid bones are bones embedded in tendons. Since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint, the angle of the tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased. Examples of sesamoid bones are the patella and the pisiform.[34]
        Irregular bones do not fit into the above categories. They consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. As implied by the name, their shapes are irregular and complicated. Often this irregular shape is due to their many centers of ossification or because they contain bony sinuses. The bones of the spine, pelvis, and some bones of the skull are irregular bones. Examples include the ethmoid and sphenoid bones

        See also: Skeleton, Human skeleton, and List of bones of the human skeleton
        Bones serve a variety of mechanical functions. Together the bones in the body form the skeleton. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).

        Bones protect internal organs, such as the skull protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs. Because of the way that bone is formed, bone has a high compressive strength of about 170 MPa (1,700 kgf/cm2),poor tensile strength of 104-121 MPa, and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa). This means that bone resists pushing (compressional) stress well, resist pulling (tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially brittle, bone does have a significant degree of elasticity, contributed chiefly by collagen.

        Mechanically, bones also have a special role in hearing. The ossicles are three small bones in the middle ear which are involved in sound transduction.

        <div class="title-bones-1">Synthetic</div>
        The cancellous part of bones contain bone marrow. Bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis.[44] Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells.Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells.Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50-100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.

        As well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.

        <div class="title-bones-1">Metabolic</div>
        Mineral storage -bones act as reserves of minerals important for the body, most notably calcium and phosphorus.[49][50][51]
        Determined by the species, age, and the type of bone, bone cells make up to 15 percent of the bone. Growth factor storage—mineralized bone matrix stores important growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor, bone morphogenetic proteins and others.

        Fat storage  marrow adipose tissue (MAT) acts as a storage reserve of fatty acids.
        Acid-base balance bone buffers the blood against excessive pH changes by absorbing or releasing alkaline salts.
        Detoxification bone tissues can also store heavy metals and other foreign elements, removing them from the blood and reducing their effects on other tissues. These can later be gradually released for excretion.
        Endocrine organ bone controls phosphate metabolism by releasing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which acts on kidneys to reduce phosphate reabsorption. Bone cells also release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.
        Calcium balance  the process of bone resorption by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation and is an important process in regulating calcium balance. As bone formation actively fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively unfixes it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.

    <div class="elbow-joints">
      <div class="title-b">Elbow-Joints</div>
    <div class="hand-joints-1">Introduction</div>
    The elbow joint, although non-weight bearing, may be the most complex joint in the human body. The elbow is a synovial hinge joint made up of articulations of mainly the distal humerus and the proximal ulna. However, articulations exist between the proximal radius and the humerus as well as the proximal radius and ulna.  The three articulations are referred to as the ulnohumeral, radiohumeral, and proximal radioulnar joints respectively. Many of the muscles of both the upper and lower arm either cross or attach to at least one component of the elbow joint making it no surprise that after the shoulder, the elbow joint is the second most commonly injured joint in sports-related injuries.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Structure and Function</div>
    The elbow is a complex synovial joint which allows for significant motion and function primarily in the form of extension and flexion, however, the elbow joint also facilitates motion in the hand in the form of supination and pronation of the forearm. The main stability of the elbow joint results from the osseous articulations of the trochlea of the humerus and the ulnar olecranon. The olecranon resembles a scoop or a wrench in which a landmark referred to as the trochlear notch, fits around the trochlea of the humerus and serves as the primary pivot point during flexion and extension of the elbow joint.  The trochlear notch wraps around the humerus almost 180 degrees, while the trochlea of the humerus is wide with a central groove, this allows for a tight conforming of the two structures, adding to the stability.  After the osseous articulations of the humerus and ulna (ulnohumeral articulation), the rest of the major stability components of the elbow joint comes from two strong ligaments in the form of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL).  Both the LCL and the MCL form into the joint capsule to provide further stability.

    The Medial collateral ligament is a triangular-shaped ligament made up of three smaller ligaments named the anterior oblique ligament, posterior oblique ligament, and the transverse ligament, also sometimes called Cooper's ligament. The anterior oblique ligament originates from the anterior inferior surface of the medial epicondyle of the humerus and inserts onto the coronoid process of the ulna. The anterior oblique ligament is the strongest and most important medial stabilizer of the elbow joint and protects against excessive valgus forces.   The posterior oblique ligament also originates from the medial epicondyle but as its name suggests, runs posteriorly to insert onto the olecranon of the ulna.  The transverse ligament passes between the previous two, running from the coronoid process and the tip of the olecranon.

    The lateral collateral ligament is also composed of three parts; the annular ligament, the lateral radial collateral ligament, and the lateral ulnar collateral ligament.  The three components of the LCL provide stability during varus stresses applied on the elbow and posterolateral rotational stability.  The lateral ulnar collateral ligament is the predominant stabilizer in posterolateral rotational structure as it crosses over the inferior aspect of the radial head, originating from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and inserting at the supinator crest of the ulna.  The annular ligament stabilizes the proximal radioulnar joint and originates and inserts at the sigmoid notch of the ulna as it wraps around the neck of the radius.[2]

    The cubital tunnel is a clinically significant space allowing the passage of the ulnar nerve.  The roof of the cubital tunnel is created by the arcuate (Osborne's) ligament running from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon of the ulna. The floor of the cubital tunnel is made up of the MCL, while the anterior, posterior, and lateral borders are comprised of the medial epicondyle, medial head of the triceps brachii, and the olecranon respectively.  

    As a synovial joint, the elbow has a synovial membrane as well as a joint capsule which are separated from each other by fat pads.  These fat pads are located superficial to areas of stress.  These areas include the olecranon, coronoid and radial fossas.  During flexion and extension, these fat pads are pulled away by attachments to the brachialis and the triceps brachii to allow space for bony processes. A lubricating bursa, namely the olecranon bursa, facilitates triceps action. This bursa serves as a lubricating component between the olecranon process of the ulna and the triceps tendon of insertion.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Embryology</div>
    During the 12th week of gestation, ossification begins in the bones that comprise the elbow joint. This ossification starts in the lower epiphysis of the humerus, followed by the trochlear notch of the ulna and the head of the radius. Towards the end of the embryonic period,  the groove between the olecranon process and the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle is visible. The tunnel of the ulnar nerve develops at the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle followed by the elbow joint cavity at the level of the humeroradial and humeroulnar joints. Next, the annular ligament develops, followed up by the formation of the joint cavity of the superior radioulnar joint.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Blood Supply and Lymphatics</div>
    The elbow joint serves as a crossing for most of the neurovasculature in the upper extremity.  The superficial nature of most of these structures allows a provider to visualize many of these structures using ultrasound.  The brachial artery is one of the continuations of the axillary artery and is the source of all the main arteries feeding into the elbow joint.  The branches of the brachial artery include a deep brachial artery which courses posteriorly to give rise to a few other small arteries which ultimately anastomose with the radial artery. The majority of the blood flow travels through the brachial artery distally and branches into the radial and ulnar arteries. 

    The major lymphatic structures around the elbow joint are the deep and superficial cubital lymph nodes, and the epitrochlear and supratrochlear lymph nodes, the latter comprising up to five nodes lying superior to the medial epicondyle. Lymph drains up the arm and passes through the deep brachial lymph nodes, eventually ending up in the axillary lymph nodes.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Narve</div>
    The nerves that cross the elbow joint predominately innervate structures of the forearm and hand. One of the major nerves responsible for acting on the elbow joint is the musculocutaneous nerve.  This nerve never crosses the elbow joint itself, but rather innervates both the biceps brachii, the muscle that accounts for the majority of supination as well as some elbow flexion, and the brachialis muscle, which is responsible for elbow flexion. 

    The radial nerve starts medially in the proximal humerus, then spirals posteriorly and laterally into the spiral groove.  The radial nerve crosses the elbow joint as it courses laterally and enters the groove for the radial nerve in the distal humerus.  The radial nerve innervates five muscles that affect the elbow joint including the brachialis (lateral portion), the anconeus, the supinator muscle, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii.

    The ulnar nerve stays in the medial arm and travels from the anterior compartment to the posterior compartment where it enters into the cubital tunnel and the groove for the ulnar nerve.  The ulnar nerve innervates muscles in the forearm and hand.

    The median nerve traverses the elbow joint anteriorly and continues distally to innervate the muscles in the forearm and hand.

    Also spanning the elbow joint is the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve derived from the musculocutaneous and radial nerves respectively.  These two nerves supply sensory information for the skin of the forearm.

    <div class="hand-joints-1"> Muscles</div>
    Many muscles cross over and attach around the elbow joint.  These muscles are responsible for the secondary stabilization of the joint.  The majority of the muscles originating from the elbow joint provide very little motion at the elbow joint itself, but rather act as flexors and extensors of the wrist, hand, and digits. Contribution to elbow stability comes in the form of protection against varus and valgus forces. Muscles that protect against valgus forces by initiating a varus force include the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and the pronator teres.  Muscles that contribute to varus stability by initiating a valgus force include extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis brevis and longus, anconeus, and extensor carpi ulnaris.

    Muscles which act primarily on the elbow joint include those responsible for flexion, including biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and brachialis.  The biceps brachii has a modest impact on elbow flexion and acts as the primary muscle responsible for supination.  The biceps brachii is especially unique as it has two distal attachments at the elbow joint, a more laterally oriented tendon inserting on the proximal radius, and a medially oriented aponeurosis which continues into the fascia of the proximal forearm.  Extension of the elbow joint is accomplished almost entirely from contraction of the triceps brachii with very modest action from the anconeus muscle.[6][7]


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Physiologic Variants</div>
    There are a few normal osseous and non-osseous variants within the elbow joint, as well as some abnormal osseous variants that can cause deficits in function.

    Pseudodefect of the capitellum is one of the normal osseous variants that exist.  In this variant, a groove exists in between the capitellum and the lateral epicondyle.  This groove can be seen on MRI and can sometimes be mistaken for an osteochondral defect.

    The supracondylar process is a bony spur that can show up in up to 3% of individuals.  These can sometimes be mistaken for osteochondromas of the humerus.  In some cases of prominent supracondylar processes, median nerve and more rarely, brachial artery compression can occur due to a fibrous band called the ligament of Struthers which runs from the supracondylar process to the medial epicondyle.

    Ligamentous variations also exist.  In several studies, four different variants of ulnar collateral ligament were identified, while 23% of the specimens studied contained an accessory ligament.

    Congenital radioulnar synostosis is a rare anomaly in which the failure of segmentation results in the fusion of the radius and the ulna.  Flexion and extension are unaffected by the condition; however, supination and pronation are.  This condition may lead to consequences in the form of excessive strain on the shoulder and wrist.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Surgical Considerations</div>
    Medial collateral ligament tears are frequently seen in professional baseball players due to the extreme amount of torque placed on the elbow joint by pitchers.  "Tommy John surgery" has become the more recognizable name for the surgery performed to repair the medial (ulnar) ligament.  Surgery success is high and the return to play is approximately 90%.

    Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) is very common especially in an aging population and is caused by repetitive flexion and valgus force on the elbow joint.  Typically, these are treated conservatively using NSAIDs, ice, and steroid injections. However, treatment-refractory epicondylitis may be treated arthroscopically and has been shown to reduce pain in an affected individual. The surgery consists of debridement of the common flexor tendon insertion at the medial epicondyle, thus relieving stress on the medial epicondyle.

    Distal biceps tendon ruptures account for about 10% of all biceps ruptures and occur after a sudden extension force applied to a flexed arm.  The majority of these injuries are complete ruptures where the tendon of insertion avulses from the radial tuberosity.  Tears of the bicipital aponeurosis may or may not occur in these cases. Operative treatment where the tendon is reinserted onto the radial tuberosity is generally preferred unless the patient is elderly in which case management is non-surgical. The clinical outcome of such surgeries is usually very positive.

    Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow is an avascular necrosis of the articular cartilage as well as the subchondral bone in the capitellum.  It predominately occurs in young athletes and can be treated using debridement, drilling, micro-fracturing, and fragment fixation procedures when conservative measures fail.

    There are many other surgical considerations for the elbow joint including those related to osseous and other ligamentous injuries that may occur with dislocation and blunt trauma injuries.  Other minor procedures are also seen in cases of bursitis or other inflammatory conditions.


    <div class="hand-joints-1">Clinical Significance</div>
    Nursemaid's elbow is one of the more common pediatric elbow injuries in children aged 6 months to 5 years.  Also called radial head subluxation, it is usually caused by an abrupt pulling force on the hand or lower arm when the arm is outstretched, resulting in a displacement of the annular ligament.  The annular ligament is responsible for holding the radius and ulna in close proximity and the proximal radioulnar joint. In this type of injury, neither the bone nor the ligament is necessarily damaged but instead have slipped out of their normal positioning. Upon injury, the patient will be in severe pain that will typically subside quickly.  Children will hold their arm on their lap or close against their body and refuse to use it.  Treatment for elbow subluxation is non-invasive and can usually be done in an outpatient office by reducing the joint.  There are two ways this is typically done.  The first method is the supination flexion method. This is done by stabilizing the elbow with one arm while flexing the child's arm to the shoulder and supinating the arm simultaneously.  You should feel the joint reduce with the stabilizing hand. The patient will be in some discomfort until joint reduction completes.  Another method gaining popularity is the hyperpronation method; in recent studies, it has been found the hyperpronation method may have higher first-time success rates.  Upon reduction, the discomfort usually subsides completely but Tylenol may be used for pain relief.

    Olecranon Bursitis occurs when there is trauma or prolonged pressure to the olecranon bursa.  Bursitis can affect any bursa in the body and is quite common.  The olecranon bursa is known to be one of the most commonly affected bursae in the human body.  The olecranon bursa is superficial, lying just underneath the skin and rests on the triceps tendon and olecranon.  Olecranon bursitis may also sometimes be referred to as student's elbow.  Prolonged pressure on the elbows such as in situations where a student leans on their elbows for prolonged periods of time, may cause inflammation of the olecranon bursa.  Olecranon bursitis may also idiopathic or septic. Septic bursitis is most often caused by trauma. The best way to diagnose a septic bursitis is aspiration and culture of bursal fluid.  Treatment of olecranon bursitis is initially conservative, with NSAID's, rest, compression, ice, and needle aspiration, which can be both therapeutic and diagnostic. If conservative management fails, operative treatment may be necessary.  Olecranon bursectomy is reserved for chronic cases that interfere with function.

    Elbow dislocations occur more frequently in athletes than in the general population, and the elbow is the second most dislocated large joint after the shoulder. Simple dislocations should be treated early with range-of-motion exercises and return to the sport, even with high-level athletes.  Patients who experience post-injury instability or have more complex dislocations where fracture or ligamentous damage occurs may require surgery. Posterior elbow dislocations often are the most severe, resulting in more ligamentous damage. If a patient experiences a dislocated elbow, it is recommended to obtain both AP and lateral radiographs before and after reducing the joint unless there is neurovascular compromise noted.  That said, a dislocated elbow should be reduced as soon as possible.
