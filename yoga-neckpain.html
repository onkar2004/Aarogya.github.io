                 Lengthen your body as you fold your upper body forward, keeping a slight bend in your knees. 
                 <li>
                   Bring your hands to your legs, a block, or the floor.

                 Child's pose can help to relieve neck pain as well as a headache.     
                
                 To do This : 
                 <ol>
                 <li>
                   From a kneeling position, sit back on your heels and bring your knees to a comfortable position.
                 </li>
                
                 <li>
                   Lengthen your spine and walk your hands in front of you, hinging your hips so that you can fold forward.
                 </li>
              
                 <li>
                   Keep your arms extended in front you to support your neck, or you can stack your hands and rest your head on them. This may help to relieve headache tension. If it’s comfortable, bring your arms back to lie along the side of your body.
